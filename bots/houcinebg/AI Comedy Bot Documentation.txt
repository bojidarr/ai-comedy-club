AI Comedy Bot Documentation
The AI Comedy Bot is a program that simulates an AI comedian by telling jokes and engaging in comedic interactions with the user. It combines a dataset of jokes with the OpenAI text-davinci-003 model for generating text and creating dynamic comedy experiences.

Getting Started
To use the AI Comedy Bot, follow the steps below:

Install the required libraries:

nltk: Install using pip install nltk.
openai: Install using pip install openai.

Obtain an OpenAI API key:

Sign up for an account on the OpenAI website (https://openai.com) if you haven't already.
Generate an API key from the OpenAI dashboard.

Prepare the joke dataset:

Create or obtain a dataset of jokes in CSV format.
The jokes should be stored in the second column of the CSV file.

Update the configuration:

Set your OpenAI API key in the gpt_api_key variable in the code.
Set the path to your jokes file in the jokes_file variable in the code.

Usage
The AI Comedy Bot provides the following functionality:

Performance:

The bot welcomes the user to the AI Comedy Club and asks for their mood.
Based on the user's mood, the bot tells jokes to make them happy, cheer them up if they are sad, or change their mood if they are bored.
The bot asks if the user wants more jokes and continues telling jokes until the user declines.
If the user is sad or bored, the bot also asks the user to tell a joke and rates it for humor.
Interact with the crowd:

The bot warms up the crowd by generating crowd interaction phrases using the text-davinci-003 model.
The bot displays the generated phrases and waits for user input.
Joke selection and rating:

The bot randomly selects jokes from the provided joke dataset.
The bot rates user-provided jokes for humor using the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the nltk library.

Customization
The AI Comedy Bot can be customized as follows:

Change the name of the bot:

Modify the name attribute in the Bot class to set a different name for the bot.

Adjust text-davinci-003 model settings:

Modify the parameters in the generate_text method to change the behavior of the text-davinci-003 model.
Parameters such as max_tokens, temperature, top_p, frequency_penalty, and presence_penalty can be adjusted to modify the generated text.
